Algorithm Implementation:
Notation summary: simplex is a subset either vertex, edge or face; to make a the complex K.
		  K is the complex of topologies (vertices, edges, and faces in our case).
		  1-ring neighborhood of a vertex is the set of this vertex neighbors (other vertices to make edges with this vertex)
		  outdegree of a vertex is number of this vertex's neighbors.
		  star of a vertex is the union of simplices that contains this vertex.
